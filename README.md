# Handwritten Digit Recognition

The MNIST dataset is a database of handwritten digits. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. This is a perfect dataset to start implementing image classification where you can classify a digit from 0 to 9.

Implement a machine learning classification algorithm on image to recognize handwritten digits from a paper.
